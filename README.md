#Minimum-Edit-Distance Prototype by Anita Dyah Pertiwi-1401309

This is code to find minimum edit distance from 2 words written in Python.

Example words to use this code:
word1: anita
word2: anitaa

word1: helloworld
word2: halloworld

etc.

It nice to report a bug to me: anitapertiwi@student.upi.edu
Thank you!
